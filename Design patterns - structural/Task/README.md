# Creational Design Patterns in C++

## Overview

This place is dedicated to my task on Creational Design Patterns in Advanced Object-Oriented Programming in C++. Creational design patterns are fundamental in C++ programming, offering a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic. This approach not only enhances the flexibility of the code but also adheres to the principle of dependency inversion, making the code more maintainable and testable.

## About the Coursework

The Task delves into:

- **Abstract Factory**: This design pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. Through the coursework, I explore how different factories can produce objects that can interact with each other without knowing their specific classes.

## Coursework Assignments

In this repository, you'll find my solutions to the assignments given during the course. These assignments include implementing different creational patterns to solve specific problems, such as:

- Implementing the Abstract Factory pattern to create UI elements that are consistent across different operating systems without directly coupling the code to the OS-specific classes.
