Within this repository, you'll find my personal solutions, explorations, and reflections on the following topics:

1. SOLID Principles - The cornerstone principles for object-oriented software design.
2. SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) - Approaches to ensuring a class addresses a single functionality or concern.
3. OCP (Open-Closed Principle) - Techniques for making software entities extendable without requiring modifications.
4. LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle) - Ensuring substitutability of derived classes for their base classes without errors.
5. ISP (Interface Segregation Principle) - Creating fine-grained interfaces that cater specifically to client needs.
6. DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle) - Reducing dependencies among modules by relying on abstractions rather than concretions.
